How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

At anypoint of time i can roll back my new changes.
Easy to identify typo.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

pros
we can reduce the number of commits so it easy to check the history.
cons
u dont have a detailed step by step variations

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

in programming, multiple files are invoived to complete a single feature. So saving altogeather will be meaningfull

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
